        <h1>Dev's Tea</h1>
        <p>I possess. The feline pursued the rodent, squeezing into a small container to pounce on the miniature furry
            creature. I leaped off the balcony, landing on a stranger's head, or rather, relished perching atop litter
            boxes, the spot where I claim space. My feline companions lack this luxury; I embrace the refined life of a
            cat. Scratching drapes signifies understanding your position in my domain. Still, I find solace sitting on
            laptops, stretching comfortably </p>
        <h2>Devs himself Doesn't Like Tea</h2>
        <p>Palindrome enthusiasts adore 'taco cat'—it reads the same backward and forward. I provoke the elderly, grumpy
            cat, engaging in a brief scuffle before retiring to tidy up my retreat. Love translates to blinks and
            ceaseless purring. Yawns bring about a 'cat-ass-trophy' moment! Laser pointers turn into miniature mice, or
            I opt to scoot my behind along the rug. Regrettably, I occasionally leave a mess in the bed at night, yet I
            indulge in prolonged naps throughout the day. When I spot a bird, I fixate, meow, and do a playful wiggle,
            beckoning the bird closer. I'm drawn to keyboards at night, sometimes settling on your chest, softly purring
            to lull you to sleep. At 4 AM, I promptly awaken humans for breakfast </p>
        <h2>But Devs Will Be Happy if You Like Her Tea</h2>
        <p>Although my water bowl sparkles and brims anew, I'll opt for a toilet drink and a feast on delectable moths,
            swiping at the fat cat's grub and leaving a fragrant mark on the walls. It smells like a morning feast! Oh,
            you there, human with the tantalizing hands—share your food with me, please? Oh, your food? Meh, not feeling
            it. Instead, I'll scout an empty cupboard niche and snooze the day away. Sniffing everything in sight, fish
            dine-in-style on the floor, but friends aren't part of my menu. Munching on grass only to regurgitate it
            later is my thing. </p>
